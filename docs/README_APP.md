# UDIO Prompt Crafter

Welcome to the UDIO Prompt Crafter, a powerful tool designed to help musicians, producers, and hobbyists create detailed and effective prompts for the UDIO music generation platform.

## What is This App For?

Crafting the perfect prompt is key to getting great results from AI music generators. This application provides a structured, guided environment to build high-quality prompts by exploring a comprehensive taxonomy of musical styles, moods, instruments, and production techniques. Instead of guessing which keywords work, you can browse, select, and combine tags with confidence.

## Key Features

-   **Expanded Taxonomy:** Browse a massively expanded, curated library of tags across categories like Genre, Mood, Era, Instrumentation, and Production. Each tag includes a description to help you understand its meaning.
-   **Live Prompt Preview:** See your prompt string update in real-time. A resizable panel allows you to view and copy your prompt, generate an AI-powered prose description, and brainstorm AI-generated song titles.
-   **UDIO-Specific Parameters:** A dedicated panel to control instrumental toggles, provide custom lyrics, and set track duration, which are saved with presets and history.
-   **Draggable Category Ordering:** Easily re-order categories to control the structure and emphasis of your final prompt.
-   **AI-Powered Assistance:**
    -   **AI Prompt Description:** Generate an evocative, prose-style prompt from your tags.
    -   **AI Song Title Generation:** Brainstorm creative song title ideas based on your prompt.
    -   **AI Prompt Deconstruction:** Paste in an existing prompt, and the AI will analyze it and select the matching tags for you.
    -   **Thematic Randomizer:** An AI-powered tool to generate a cohesive set of tags based on a simple theme (e.g., "cyberpunk rainy night").
    -   **AI-Powered Songwriting:** Generate creative lyrical theme ideas based on keywords and then expand them into full song lyrics with verses and choruses.
    -   **Tag Suggestions:** Get recommendations for complementary tags.
-   **Streamlined Taxonomy Editor:** A fully redesigned, inline editor on the Settings page allows for stable and intuitive management of your custom tag library. The buggy modal has been completely replaced.
-   **Icon Customization:** Choose from four popular icon sets (Heroicons, Lucide, Feather, Tabler) to personalize the application's appearance.
-   **UI Scaling:** Customize the application's size with a simple slider in the settings, ranging from 50% to 400% for improved accessibility and comfort.
-   **Prompt History:** Automatically saves your last 50 prompts. Revisit and load any past creation with a single click from the new history modal.
-   **Presets:** Save and manage your favorite tag combinations as presets for later use.
-   **Conflict Detection:** The app automatically warns you if you select tags that conflict with each other (e.g., "Minimalist" and "Maximalist").
-   **Command Palette:** A powerful search tool (`Ctrl+;`) to quickly find and toggle any tag, or execute actions like loading a preset or clearing the board.
-   **Standard Data Location:** In the desktop version, all your data (presets, settings, custom taxonomy, logs) is stored in the standard user application data directory (e.g., `%APPDATA%` on Windows). This makes the application behave like a standard installed program and keeps your data safe during updates.
