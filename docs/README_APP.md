# UDIO Prompt Crafter

Welcome to the UDIO Prompt Crafter, a powerful tool designed to help musicians, producers, and hobbyists create detailed and effective prompts for the UDIO music generation platform.

## What is This App For?

Crafting the perfect prompt is key to getting great results from AI music generators. This application provides a structured, guided environment to build high-quality prompts by exploring a comprehensive taxonomy of musical styles, moods, instruments, and production techniques. Instead of guessing which keywords work, you can browse, select, and combine tags with confidence.

## Key Features

-   **Comprehensive Taxonomy:** Browse a curated library of hundreds of tags across categories like Genre, Mood, Era, Instrumentation, and Production. Each tag includes a description to help you understand its meaning.
-   **Live Prompt Preview:** See your prompt string and a structured JSON output update in real-time as you select and deselect tags.
-   **Draggable Category Ordering:** Easily re-order categories to control the structure and emphasis of your final prompt.
-   **Presets:** Save your favorite tag combinations as presets for later use.
-   **AI-Powered Assistance:** Use the AI features to get suggestions for complementary tags or generate lyrical theme ideas based on your current selection.
-   **Conflict Detection:** The app automatically warns you if you select tags that conflict with each other (e.g., "Minimalist" and "Maximalist").
-   **Command Palette:** A powerful search tool (`Ctrl+;`) to quickly find and toggle any tag, or execute actions like loading a preset or clearing the board.
-   **File-Based Settings:** When running the desktop version, all your custom presets and settings are saved to a local file, making them persistent across sessions.
